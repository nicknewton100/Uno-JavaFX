# Uno JavaFX
Uno JavaFX is the game of Uno created in Java using the JavaFX libraries. You are put up against an AI opponent to see who will win the game. 

To install the game, make sure you have a recent version of java installed or it will not open. You can download the game here: https://tinyurl.com/33kessm8

#### *-- The game does have a few visual bugs that I plan to iron out soon once when I find the time and also needs a code reformat/overhaul --*
